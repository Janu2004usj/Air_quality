# Air_quality
📌 Project Objective
To build a predictive model that assesses air quality levels using features like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, and other pollutants. This model helps raise awareness of pollution levels and provides data-driven insights for environmental monitoring.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Air Quality Data

The dataset contains measurements of multiple pollutants over time including:

PM2.5

PM10

NO2

CO

O3

AQI (Air Quality Index)

Date and Location

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning algorithms

XGBoost – Advanced ML model

LabelEncoder / OneHotEncoder – Categorical handling

Train-Test Split – Data splitting

Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report – Model evaluation
